# Kanji-Dictionary

Uses webscraping available through the JSoup Library to scrape a table from jlptsensei.com in order to display the levels given from the site and displays it in a friendly user
interface for people to lookup and search in. Used for learning Kanji, but also helped me learn very light webscraping or give a little introduction and using
external libraries for future projects.
